# COVID19SequenceParser
A simple java script that takes an alignment output (FASTA) and outputs all the differences with the Reference Sequence.
Based on a fork of Diff-Match-Patch library from Neil Freser, that has been modified to return indexes of the differences in the strings.
This script is part of the project for the Course of Bioinformatics @ UniMib
